  abstract = {Video games are a ubiquitous part of almost all children's and adolescents' lives, with 97\% playing for at least one hour per day in the United States. The vast majority of research by psychologists on the effects of ``gaming'' has been on its negative impact: the potential harm related to violence, addiction, and depression. We recognize the value of that research; however, we argue that a more balanced perspective is needed, one that considers not only the possible negative effects but also the benefits of playing these games. Considering these potential benefits is important, in part, because the nature of these games has changed dramatically in the last decade, becoming increasingly complex, diverse, realistic, and social in nature. A small but significant body of research has begun to emerge, mostly in the last five years, documenting these benefits. In this article, we summarize the research on the positive effects of playing video games, focusing on four main domains: cognitive, motivational, emotional, and social. By integrating insights from developmental, positive, and social psychology, as well as media psychology, we propose some candidate mechanisms by which playing video games may foster real-world psychosocial benefits. Our aim is to provide strong enough evidence and a theoretical rationale to inspire new programs of research on the largely unexplored mental health benefits of gaming. Finally, we end with a call to intervention researchers and practitioners to test the positive uses of video games, and we suggest several promising directions for doing so.},

Results of Study 2 supported the hypothesized association between ADOG and students' self-regulated learning, which consisted of academic motivation and the use of cognitive, metacognitive, and resource management learning strategies. Discriminant validity of the ADOGS is indicated by its stronger correlations with students' self-regulation than found for instruments that measure closelyrelated constructs (generalized deferment of gratification and impulsivity). The conceptual status of ADOG as a strategy and outcome of successful strategy use is discussed.},

The EME is based on the tenets of self-determination theory and is composed of 28 items subdivided into seven sub-scales assessing three types of intrinsic motivation (intrinsic motivation to know, to accomplish things, and to experience stimulation), three types of extrinsic motivation (external, introjected, and identified regulation), and a motivation. The purpose of this investigation was to cross-culturally validate in English the EME. The EME was translated in English through appropriate methodological procedures and completed by university students. Results revealed that the English version of the scale renamed the Academic Motivation Scale (AMS), has satisfactory levels of internal consistency (mean alpha value = .81) and temporal stability over a one-month period (mean test-retest correlation = .79). In addition, results of a confirmatory factor analysis (LISREL) confirmed the seven-factor structure of the AMS. Finally, gender differences obtained with the EME were basically replicated with the AMS. In sum, the present findings provide adequate support for the factorial validity and reliability of the AMS and support its use in educational research on motivation.},

  issn = {00029602, 15375390},
  abstract = {This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the structural determinants of power in exchange networks, along with research findings from laboratory experiments and a computer simulation of bargaining in network structures. Two theoretical traditions are dealth with: (1) point centrality in graph-theoretic representations of structure, as an approach to power distributions; and (2) power dependence principles applied to exchange networks. Measures of centrality available in the literature have the advantage of being easily applied to large and complex networks. In contrast, power dependence concepts were conceived for use in microsociology and are found to be cumbersome in the analysis of complex networks. But despite the relative difficulty of applying power-dependence theory to network structures, that approach generates hypotheses about power distributions which are confirmed at nearly every point in a laboratory experiment with five-person networks and at every point in a computer simulation of networks too large for laboratory study. In contrast, centrality measures applied to the type of networks studied fail to predict power distributions. Although centrality measures might predict power in some networks, their generality is limited. Toward resolution of the issues raised, this study offers two theoretical points: (1) a distinction between two different principles of "connection" in social networks suggests that current measures of centrality might predict power in one type of network but not in the other; and (2) it offers a first step toward a fusion of power-dependence theory and structural centrality in a way which might be general across networks of both types.},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0010232},
  abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance data acquired in a task-absent condition (``resting state'') require new data analysis techniques that do not depend on an activation model. In this work, we introduce an alternative assumption- and parameter-free method based on a particular form of node centrality called eigenvector centrality. Eigenvector centrality attributes a value to each voxel in the brain such that a voxel receives a large value if it is strongly correlated with many other nodes that are themselves central within the network. Google's PageRank algorithm is a variant of eigenvector centrality. Thus far, other centrality measures - in particular ``betweenness centrality'' - have been applied to fMRI data using a pre-selected set of nodes consisting of several hundred elements. Eigenvector centrality is computationally much more efficient than betweenness centrality and does not require thresholding of similarity values so that it can be applied to thousands of voxels in a region of interest covering the entire cerebrum which would have been infeasible using betweenness centrality. Eigenvector centrality can be used on a variety of different similarity metrics. Here, we present applications based on linear correlations and on spectral coherences between fMRI times series. This latter approach allows us to draw conclusions of connectivity patterns in different spectral bands. We apply this method to fMRI data in task-absent conditions where subjects were in states of hunger or satiety. We show that eigenvector centrality is modulated by the state that the subjects were in. Our analyses demonstrate that eigenvector centrality is a computationally efficient tool for capturing intrinsic neural architecture on a voxel-wise level.},

  abstract = {Bourdieu describes the structure of society as a result of class conflicts and status competition. Art in general, and the literary field in particular, is interpreted as a differentiated social field that is autonomous in the sense that it follows its own logic - the competition for cultural legitimation. What literature has in common with other social systems is the stratification of its internal structure into a hierarchical arrangement. Thus the literary field can be described as a horizontally differentiated system that is, however, vertically differentiated internally.The concern of the paper is to test Bourdieu's theoretical considerations empirically. Data for the analysis and interpretation are based on interviews of Cologne writers. The data are analysed with the aid of blockmodel and correspondence analysis. As far as the data allows us to operationalise the thesis that the literary field is an autonomous differentiated system, Bourdieu's thesis is confirmed. The internal structure can be described more precisely: the first line of demarcation is, in fact, the difference that Bourdieu described between legitimate and illegitimate art: high-culture literature and low-culture literature are the two poles of the literary field. The realm of the legitimate literature is further differentiated into three blocks (elite, junior elite, periphery). The elite and the periphery differ in terms of the different degrees of success. The junior elite occupies an intermediate place. Bourdieu's sociology of literature is supported by the empirical material at hand.},

First, the leaders in an industry seek to differentiate themselves from their chief competitors. Second, the firms of the middle stratum imitate the leaders in their industry extensively by choosingfrom the same set of auditors. Third, the firms at the bottom seem to be excluded from this concern. This interplay between inclusion and exclusion among socially differentiated actors, in turn, yields substantial polarization in size among CPA firms and hence the extreme market share concentration that characterizes the audit services market.},

In addition, the prestige of artists and institutions are intertwined. Artists derive their prestige at least in part from their affiliations to art organizations, and the prestige of organizations is based on the artists which they are able to take on. This paper introduces a simple but efficient index to measure dynamic prestige from a longitudinal network of affiliations. It is shown that the prestige of literary magazines can be computed from the flow of authors between magazines and that it correlates strongly with external indicators of literary prestige. An advanced method for analyzing longitudinal networks was used to demonstrate that this index of prestige predicts the exchange of authors between magazines whereas static indices of prestige do not. The results corroborate the relational and dynamic character of positions within the literary field postulated in the field theory of Pierre Bourdieu.},

This paper does two things: (1) it provides a typology of the distribution of uncertainty in galleries based on the kinds of artistic and personal resources available to the dealer; and, (2) it identifies strategies used by galleries to manage different levels of uncertainty.

It is argued that the degree of overlap of two individuals' friendship networks varies directly with the strength of their tie to one another. The impact of this principle on diffusion of influence and information, mobility opportunity, and community organization is explored. Stress is laid on the cohesive power of weak ties. Most network models deal, implicitly, with strong ties, thus confining their applicability to small, well-defined groups. Emphasis on weak ties lends itself to discussion of relations between groups and to analysis of segments of social structure not easily defined in terms of primary groups.},

While most sociologists know about Bourdieu's study Distinction (1986) and its analysis of consumption, there is less awareness of the fact that Bourdieu himself, towards the end of his life, said that he had produced three major studies of economic topics. These are: his work in Algeria on `the economy of honour and ``good faith''' (1950s and 1960s); his study of credit (Bourdieu et al., 1963); and his study of the economy of single-family houses (Bourdieu et al., 1999). These three studies are presented and discussed in detail, and so is Bourdieu's attempt to formulate a general program for `economic anthropology' in his article `The Economic Field' (1997), drawing on such concepts as field, habitus and capital. Some critique has been directed at Bourdieu's analysis of the economy, and this is also discussed.},

I develop a conceptual view of the social institutions that comprise markets, discuss a sociological model of action in which market participants try to create stable worlds and find social solutions to competition, and discuss how markets and states are intimately linked. From these foundations, I generate propositions about how politics in markets work during various stages of market development--formation, stability, and transformation. At the formation of markets, when actors in firms are trying to create a status hierarchy that enforces noncompetitive forms of competition, political action resembles social movements. In stable markets, incumbent firms defend their positions against challengers and invaders. During periods of market transformation, invaders can reintroduce more fluid social-movement-like conditions.},

We first draw the space of positions in poetry, before offering powerful methodological methods to analyze artistic careers\textemdash{}that is, sequence analysis that we combine with logit models. We show that, in contrast to the intuition of Bourdieu (1996) in The Rules of Art, poetry is not characterized by anarchy but, instead, is a very structured social space wherein recognition is consensual, as well as hierarchized. We then show that careers at the pure pole are long, progressively cumulative and irregular. These results refine previous studies where slow accumulation of reputation corresponded to linear, if not regular, careers (e.g., Giuffre, 1999). We also discusses cumulative advantage theory (e.g., Menger, 2009), as well as status-based models of hierarchies (e.g., Podolny, 2005), so as to offer a usable model of objectivizing artists' positions in their field. We thus build on Bourdieu and his followers, who have offered insights but little systemic investigation of the organization of the pure pole, whereas it plays a key conceptual role in the sociology of literature and, indeed, in the Bourdieusian framework.},

Formal network analysis mainly aims at a description of network structures as well as at an explanation of the behavior of the network at the systemic level. Formal network analysis can also be used in order to explain individual behavior or the existence of individual connections from network structure. Statistical analyses of ego-centered networks are used to correlate individual attributes with the structure and composition of the individual embeddedness, thus providing a statistical explanation of network effects and determinants. Qualitative methods are important for exploring network structures, and for understanding the meaning connected to them. A historical overview shows that these three strands have long co-existed in sociological network research without engaging in combined research efforts. Combinations of these methods prove useful when considering the various aspects of networks (individual connections, structural patterns, and meaning).},

Evaluation and classification practices were examined and operationalized from the perspective of literary field theory. The value that is attributed to authors by literary institutions and their agents was taken as the main indicator of literary prestige. Value attribution was measured by establishing the attention authors receive from such institutions as literary encyclopedias, literary prizes, academic studies, and publishing houses. Measurements were conducted for 502 authors varying in both critical acclaim and public appeal. The statistical technique Princals was used to analyze institutions' measures. The results show that one dimension stood out, which was interpreted as authors' literary prestige. Given its institutional base, this form of prestige is called Institutional Literary Prestige (ILP). The subsequent classification of authors met expectations. However, further validations of the instrument are recommended.},

Drawing from extensive ethnographic, survey, and interview data gathered in Paris, New York, and Toronto, we explore the social dynamics of readings in order to understand better how these public and social gatherings contribute to poetry economies and careers. While differences exist between the locations for our research, the similarities are striking: we find that readings are crucial to poetry economies because they foster and maintain distribution networks for contemporary poetry in a global marketplace that tends to `squeeze out' forms of art that lack broad commercial appeal. We also find, across these locations, that readings are used in different ways by poets at different stages of career (i.e., unestablished, established, and wellestablished) and by poets operating in different genres (i.e., those writing `for the stage' versus those writing `for the page'). Finally, we emphasize that readings provide an important space in which poets and others (e.g., booksellers, publishers) navigate the difficulties of making art while dealing with the necessities of money. \# 2010 Elsevier B.V.

A multilevel design is needed to account for dependencies among ties and vertices, which should not be ignored in a small longitudinal network. Time-varying covariates are required to analyze network effects, that is, the impact of previous ties. In addition, a discrete-time event history model handles constraints on who can act or who can be acted upon in a straightforward way. The model can be estimated with multilevel logistic regression analysis, which is illustrated by an application to book reviews, so network evolution can be analyzed with a fairly standard statistical tool.},

My approach combines Bourdieu's field theory with Abbott's analysis of professional development. The mechanisms of consecration must be contextualized within the political and economic constraints that the literary field is subjected to. Because of its relatively weak professional development, the consecrating authorities play a major role in the regulating of the literary field and in the building of careers. This article examines literary institutions which appear in different periods: the Acad\'emie fran{\c c}aise, which obtained its power from the state under the Old Regime; the societies of authors and the publishers, which contributed to the professional development of literary activity with the growth of the book market and the withdrawal of the state from the control of this market; the literary journals as relatively autonomous authorities; the literary prizes that are torn between autonomy and heteronomy (with the Goncourt prize as an example); the role of translation and international circulation in the process of consecration; and finally, the festival as a new form of literary recognition, which reflects the process of democratization (based on an empirical study on Les Correspondances de Manosque).},

The results show that, in all three countries, authors who have properties that signal the market logic become more dominant, while retrospectively consecrated authors less often make the lists.

  abstract = {Der Artikel zeigt zun\"achst Zusammenh\"ange zwischen Korrespondenz- und Netzwerkanalyse auf, vor allem in Bezug auf ihre gemeinsame Ausgangsbasis, die aus Affiliationen von Akteuren zu Organisationen besteht. Besonders interessant ist in diesem eher technischen Vergleich die Verbindung aus Theorie und Mathematik: Die Korrespondenzanalyse hebt exklusive Merkmale hervor, was zu Bourdieus Konzept des Distinktionsgewinns passt (312). 

Der Autor weist anschlie\ss{}end darauf hin, dass Bourdieu die Anwendung netzwerkanalytischer Verfahren aus zwei Gr\"unden ablehnte: "mistaking consequences for causes and disregarding time and history" (317). 
1) Bourdieu unterscheidet Struktur bzw. objektive Relationen von Interaktion bzw. intersubjektive Relationen. Erstere sind latent vorhanden und k\"onnen durch Korrespondenzanalyse extrahiert werden. Letztere sind manifest und sind der Gegenstand von Studien, die aus der Perspektive des symbolischen Interaktionismus und der Netzwerkanalyse durchgef\"uhrt werden. Interaktionen sind jedoch eher das Resultat objektiver Relationen, als dass sie die Gr\"unde f\"ur Sozialstruktur darstellen.
2) "Bourdieu's second objection to symbolic interactionism concerns its exclusive focus on the present, which entails a denial of the past. Symbolic interactionists grant the person a lot of freedom in assigning symbolic value to the actions and interactions that s/he perceives. According to Bourdieu, however, this freedom is very limited because the symbolic value of behavior is strongly guided by categories of perception that originated in the past and that have been transmitted from generation to generation through processes of socialization."

Der Autor sieht Netzwerkanalyse jedoch als Erweiterung der Feld- und Praxistheorie: "In my opinion, objective relations are not autonomous forces that directly and continuously affect each field. They become operative when people or organizations take part in the interaction within a field, bringing to bear properties and qualifications characteristic of another field. This triggers a group process, creating winners and losers among the members of the field (micro effect) and repositioning the field with respect to the `challenging' field (macro effect). In the process new symbolic distinctions and values are being created or existing ones are being reaffirmed or discarded.
Therefore, it is important to analyze how, when, and to what extent objective relations affect the interaction and structure of a field as well as the symbolic value of categories and qualifications in a particular period. Correspondence analysis cannot perform this task because it abstracts from the actual interaction among. Network analysis is indispensable here."

Im weiteren Verlauf werden noch Hinweise auf Studien gegeben, wie Interaktion die Verteilung von Kapitalsorten beeinflusst, so dass der Autor folgern kann, dass Interaktion den Effekt objektiver Strukturen mediieren und ver\"andern kann: "Objective relations do not operate on the basis of mere homology between fields."

Currents are assumed to designate certain textual constants within the development of literature, whereas movements are assumed to represent textual innovations. In this article classifications of contemporary literature are related to the positions authors and critics occupy within the field of occupations and organisations accommodating the production of literature. Authors, critics and other producers use classifications to name and order their social relationships. The careers of a number of Dutch literary authors in the 1970s were used to test the association between the networks of authors and the manner in which the authors are classified according to movement or school. Attention was paid to the networks surrounding literary magazines and publishing houses, as well as to networks resulting from evaluations, comparisons and literary orientations expressed in reviews and interviews. The research project aimed to show the interdependence of the material production of literature, i.e. the process of publishing texts, and the symbolic production, the establishment of an artistic image for a book and its makers.},

The theatrical field is formalized as an affiliation network of companies participating in stage co-productions in Italy's Campania region, over four theatre seasons. Differently from Bourdieu, but similarly to other works in the sociology of culture and the arts, the study focuses on relational and attribute-based dimensions of theatre production, presenting a novel way to combine field theory and SNA. By adopting the positional approach of SNA through Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA) and blockmodeling for affiliation networks, the study reveals oppositions among companies by reason of their differential partnerships in co-productions, and a combination of hierarchy and segmentation characterizing the network structure of the field. These oppositions also appear in the `objective' social space defined by the attributes of companies and coproductions (positions and position-takings), showing the unequal distribution of symbolic cultural capital among theatre producers and the latter's inclinations towards different theatrical styles and genres.},

However, past literature failed to explain status dynamics such as mobility in the status order where highly uncertain goods make quality hard to measure. This paper contributes to the understanding of this relationship by identifying various social mechanisms behind quality evaluation processes. It also explores why certain products are considered to be more valuable than others. The results demonstrate that only through exchange relations and active participation in the marketplace (what I call status actions) can actors affect the social definition of what are perceived as high-quality products. The results also provide evidence of two major market outcomes: conservativism and centralization. The findings improve the understanding of the evolution and dynamics of status in uncertain markets from both micro- and macro-sociology of markets. These processes are illustrated in a study of the art market in Israel.},

We have mapped relationships between the actors and thus the field structures that these relationships entail. The fields in which a segment of an art world is operating is represented in multi-dimensional figures which illustrate relationships and bonds between the different categories of organizations. Some of the business actors we have studied are engaging in cultural activities with a great deal of autonomy, others are connected to the cultural field in less active ways. In participating in the cultural field they are in different ways and to different extents accumulating symbolic capital including prestige and honor. The method we have applied is multiple correspondence analysis which was frequently used by Bourdieu.},

Galenson introduces a simple classification of creativity careers (early vs. late-bloomers), relates it to a bipartite typology of creativity (conceptual vs. experimental innovators) and builds on this typology to explain the decreasing trend of age at which artists were most creative over several generations in the 19th and 20th centuries. Drawing on Galenson's measures, the present paper uses a different approach to overcome possible criticisms to his design. Applying sequence analysis to creativity careers of 41 major modern painters, it also yields a fairly different story from the one Galenson proposes. In particular, I show that a typology of creativity should distinguish between creativity occurring within artistic movements and other forms of creativity. This distinction is important, for the decrease in age at peak creativity over time seems actually driven by the evolution of movement-related creativity alone. Investigating the specific issue of creativity over the life cycle of artists, and showing that movements and interactions play an important part in the picture, the paper thus suggests there is something more than the mere individual involved in artistic creativity.},

Yet they also find that the orchestra opened up to a new group of subscribers hailing from an emerging professional, managerial, and intellectual middle class. Importantly, the inclusion of this new audience was segregated: they did not mingle with elites in the concert hall. This segregated inclusion paved a specific way for the constitution of cultural capital. It meant that greater purity and greater inclusiveness happened together, enabling elite cultural participation to remain distinctive while elite tastes acquired broader social currency.},

Assimilating a wide range of historical and sociological data, the authors argue convincingly that the Academy, by neglecting to address the social and economic conditions of its time, undermined its own ability to maintain authority and control.Originally published in 1965, this ground-breaking work is a classic piece of empirical research in the sociology of art. In this edition, Harrison C. White's new Foreword compares the marketing approaches of two contemporary painters, while Cynthia A. White's new Afterword reviews recent scholarship in the field.},

This study seeks to analyze the field's change in the perception of relevant actors in this field. Therefore, the study applies a Grounded Theory approach, elaborating the qualitative character of this descriptive-explorative analysis. The study's empirical foundation is a set of semi-structured interviews with actors in the field of art in Hamburg, backed by secondary data obtained from the Artfacts- and Artprice data base. The study draws a detailed and distinctive picture of the field and depicts its change over time. As a main result, it is found that the field of art galleries in Hamburg, which is a subfield of the art field, is characterized by geographic clusters. While there is a remarkable center-periphery divide as well as a substantial north-south divide, there are also indications of a west-east divide. Moreover, the study shows insights about the interrelati},

excellence, risk-taking and innovation;
- How artistic excellence can encourage wider and deeper engagement with
the arts by audiences;
- How to establish a light touch and non-bureaucratic method to judge the
quality of the arts in the future.
`The arts' encompasses a variety of forms. I have focused on those supported by
public funding. These include the work of museums and galleries supported
through the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) and the Museums,
Libraries and Archives Council (MLA) and the performing and visual arts and
literature supported by Arts Council England.
This report is founded on the belief that excellent culture goes to the root of living
and is therefore relevant to every single one of us. There are many examples of
excellent work to be found in this country today, but this report suggests that with
some tuning of approach, our society could foster even more exciting and vibrant
work.},

  abstract = {In this article I develop a proposal for the theoretical vantage point of the sociology of markets, focusing on the problem of the social order of markets. The initial premise is that markets are highly demanding arenas of social interaction, which can only operate if three inevitable coordination problems are resolved. I define these coordination problems as the value problem, the problem of competition and the cooperation problem. I argue that these problems can only be resolved based on stable reciprocal expectations on the part of market actors, which have their basis in the socio-structural, institutional and cultural embedding of markets. The sociology of markets aims to investigate how market action is structured by these macrostructures and to examine their dynamic processes of change. While the focus of economic sociology has been primarily on the stability of markets and the reproduction of firms, the conceptualization developed here brings change and profit motives more forcefully into the analysis. It also differs from the focus of the new economic sociology on the supply side of markets, by emphasizing the role of demand for the order of markets, especially in the discussion of the problems of valuation and cooperation.},

On the basis of in-depth interviews with art dealers in New York and Amsterdam, I address two pricing norms: one norm inhibits art dealers from decreasing prices; the other induces them to set prices according to size. To account for these pricing norms, I argue that price setting is not just an economic but also a signifying act: despite their impersonal, businesslike connotations, actors on markets manage to express a range of cognitive and cultural meanings through prices. Previously, meanings of prices have been recognized in signaling theories within economics. However, these meanings are restricted to profit opportunities. Within the humanities, by contrast, meanings of prices are restricted to contaminating or corrosive meanings. The sociological perspective I develop claims that prices, price differences, and price changes convey multiple meanings related to the reputation of artists, the social status of dealers, and the quality of the artworks that are traded.},

We model the determinants of prices on three different levels: the work of art (size, material), the artist (age, sex, place of residence, institutional recognition), and the gallery (location, institutional affiliation, age). Our main findings are that the size and material of works of art, and the age and place of residence of the artist are strong predictors of price; that differences in size and materials partly ``mask'' price differences between artists; and that the variance in prices across galleries is largely explained by characteristics of the artists they represent.},

This process is seen as part of the overall struggle of `making names' - enacted by critics, curators, and dealers - that structures recognition, results in artistic change, and reproduces central distinctions in the fine art world. Informed by Bourdieu's formulation of cultural fields, the study is grounded in numerous sources, including fieldwork observations, secondary data analyses, a review of more than three hundred exhibitions, and interviews with key art world agents. To begin, the social organization of the mid-1980s New York art market is outlined as a spatial economy of name recognition, broadly composed of three agonistic segments. Afterward, the incorporation of a new African art into organizational and discursive structures is examined as the outcome of ongoing struggles between competing `position-takings'. Symbolic and material exigencies within the art market motivating the selection of such works, as well as specific strategies used in framing them as creations of disinterested individuals, are also examined. 0 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Second, the greater the uncertainty, the more that organizations engage in transactions with those of similar status.

Based on fifteen years of original research, they marshall historical evidence from the Roman Empire to the Soviet Union, from Korea to Africa, to build a new theory of political economy with great relevance for the big questions of today, including: China has built an authoritarian growth machine. Will it continue to grow at such high speed and overwhelm the West? Is America moving from a virtuous circle, in which efforts by elites to aggrandize power are resisted, to a vicious one that enriches and empowers a small minority? What is the most effective way to help move billions of people from the rut of poverty to prosperity? Is it through more philanthropy from the wealthy nations of the West, or learning lessons on the interplay between inclusive political and economic institutions?},

Cette interpr\'etation, qui s'appuie aussi bien sur l'\'economie de la profession d'avocat que sur une part importante et croissante de l'\'economie globale, permet d'avancer que le jugement repr\'esente, \`a c\^ot\'e de l'autorit\'e et du prix, un principe d'organisation de la vie \'economique.

When supply and demand are mainly defined by quality and an asymmetrical relation makes the client, unlike the salesman, unable to differentiate between good and bad quality, his purchase is based on judgment rather than on the price; he is more closely related to a social organisation with its network of trust, than to the neoclassical market. This interpretation, founded on both the economy of the legal profession and on an important growing part of global economy, allows one to state that alongside authority and prices, judgment represents an organisational factor of economic life. 

Wenn Angebot und Nachfrage haupts\"achlich durch die Qualit\"at bestimmt werden und eine Asymmetrische Beziehung dem Kunden, im Gegensatz zum Verk\"aufer, verbietet, m\"uhelos die gute von der schlechten Qualit\"at zu unterscheiden, fusst der Austausch eher auf einem Preiskriterium und ist eher von einer auf dem Netzwerk und dem Vertrauen begr\"undeten sozialen Organisation abh\"angig als von den Kr\"aften des neoklassischen Marktes.

Moreover, we argue that the influence of these factors on firm performance is contingent on industry context. More specifically, our empirical analysis suggests that strong ties in a highly interconnected strategic alliance network negatively impact firm performance. This network configuration is especially suboptimal for firms in the semiconductor industry. Furthermore, strong and weak ties are positively related to firm performance in the steel and semiconductor industries, respectively.},

This account acknowledges that novel ideas must be elaborated on and conceptually translated before they can be adopted and applied to field-specific problems. We motivate our account by examining an exemplary case of knowledge diffusion, namely, the early spread of theories of rational decision-making. These theories were grounded in a set of novel mathematical tools and concepts that originated in John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern's Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (1944/1947) and subsequently spread widely across the social and behavioral sciences. Introducing a network-based diffusion measure, we trace the spread of those tools and concepts into distinct research areas. We furthermore present an analytically tractable typology for classifying publications according to their roles in the diffusion process. The proposed framework allows for a systematic examination of the conditions under which scientific innovations spread within and across preexisting and newly emerging scientific communities.},

Using a cross-lagged panel design (CLPD), study 1 (N = 251) found adolescents with low moral competence to be susceptible to peer influence, while no such effect was found for adolescents with high moral competence. Study 2, a cross-sectional analysis (N = 748), found moral competence to be inversely related to the likelihood of an individual's conforming with the pro-bullying behavior of his or her peers. Neither study found corresponding effects for pro-social, defending behavior. Our findings further illuminate the associations between moral competence, peer influence, and school bullying.

Given this distinction, the article considers how the value of ``structural holes'' and market status vary with these two types of uncertainty. The article proposes that the value of structural holes increases with egocentric uncertainty, but not with altercentric uncertainty. In contrast, the value of status increases with altercentric uncertainty, but declines with egocentric uncertainty. Thus actors with networks rich in structural holes should sort into markets or market segments that are high in egocentric uncertainty; high-status actors should sort into markets that are low in egocentric uncertainty.

This study aims to explain the variation of the state of democratisation in the different countries, as well as identify the factor(s) behind this variation. Six countries are selected for the analysis; half of them experienced major changes, the other half just minor political changes. These are tested against the modernisation theory, while controlling for Huntington's theory about waves of democratisation. The chosen method is a comparative politics method, together with quantitative analysis. The result shows that, contrary to the modernisation theory and the hypothesis, economic and socioeconomic development does not explain the variation in the state of democratisation. Countries with minor political changes are, to some extent, also more developed. The result further suggests that other factors such as economic failure and monarchy's resilience could possibly explain the variation in the state of democratisation.},

Recent years have witnessed an attempt by physicists to study collective phenomena emerging from the interactions of individuals as elementary units in social structures. A wide list of topics are reviewed ranging from opinion and cultural and language dynamics to crowd behavior, hierarchy formation, human dynamics, and social spreading. The connections between these problems and other, more traditional, topics of statistical physics are highlighted. Comparison of model results with empirical data from social systems are also emphasized.},

It is shown to outperform all other known community detection methods in terms of computation time. Moreover, the quality of the communities detected is very good, as measured by the so-called modularity. This is shown first by identifying language communities in a Belgian mobile phone network of 2 million customers and by analysing a web graph of 118 million nodes and more than one billion links. The accuracy of our algorithm is also verified on ad hoc modular networks.},

To understand the role of these factors, we reconstructed the exhibition history of half a million artists, mapping out the coexhibition network that captures the movement of art between institutions. Centrality within this network captured institutional prestige, allowing us to explore the career trajectory of individual artists in terms of access to coveted institutions. Early access to prestigious central institutions offered life-long access to high-prestige venues and reduced dropout rate. By contrast, starting at the network periphery resulted in a high dropout rate, limiting access to central institutions. A Markov model predicts the career trajectory of individual artists and documents the strong path and history dependence of valuation in art.},

  abstract = {A large number of complex systems find a natural abstraction in the form of weighted networks whose nodes represent the elements of the system and the weighted edges identify the presence of an interaction and its relative strength. In recent years, the study of an increasing number of large-scale networks has highlighted the statistical heterogeneity of their interaction pattern, with degree and weight distributions that vary over many orders of magnitude. These features, along with the large number of elements and links, make the extraction of the truly relevant connections forming the network's backbone a very challenging problem. More specifically, coarse-graining approaches and filtering techniques come into conflict with the multiscale nature of large-scale systems. Here, we define a filtering method that offers a practical procedure to extract the relevant connection backbone in complex multiscale networks, preserving the edges that represent statistically significant deviations with respect to a null model for the local assignment of weights to edges. An important aspect of the method is that it does not belittle small-scale interactions and operates at all scales defined by the weight distribution. We apply our method to real-world network instances and compare the obtained results with alternative backbone extraction techniques.},

Such a ``socio-economic laboratory'' allows to unveil the intricate interplay of spatial constraints, social and economic factors, and patterns of mobility. We find that the motion of individuals is not only constrained by physical distances, but also strongly shaped by the presence of socio-economic areas. These regions can be recovered perfectly by community detection methods solely based on the measured human dynamics. Moreover, we uncover that long-term memory in the time-order of visited locations is the essential ingredient for modeling the trajectories.},

They are one of the most fundamental types of stochastic processes; can be used to model numerous phenomena, including diffusion, interactions, and opinions among humans and animals; and can be used to extract information about important entities or dense groups of entities in a network. Random walks have been studied for many decades on both regular lattices and (especially in the last couple of decades) on networks with a variety of structures. In the present article, we survey the theory and applications of random walks on networks, restricting ourselves to simple cases of single and non-adaptive random walkers. We distinguish three main types of random walks: discrete-time random walks, node-centric continuous-time random walks, and edge-centric continuous-time random walks. We first briefly survey random walks on a line, and then we consider random walks on various types of networks. We extensively discuss applications of random walks, including ranking of nodes (e.g., PageRank), community detection, respondent-driven sampling, and opinion models such as voter models.},

Other relevant factors include the placement of the paintings (on altars, ceilings or walls), whose impact reflects differences in demand elasticities. We find evidence of the law of one price confirming price equalization between high and low demand geographical destinations and between different subjects. Finally, in a Schumpeterian perspective, we relate the temporal trend of the price of a representative painting with waves of artistic innovations, whose peacks were in the 1500s and in the 1700s with a dark Baroque age in the intermediate century.},

Wealth\textendash{}income ratios, inherited wealth, and wealth inequalities were high in the eighteenth to nineteenth centuries up until World War I, then sharply dropped during the twentieth century following World War shocks, and have been rising again in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. We discuss the models that can account for these facts. We show that over a wide range of models, the long-run magnitude and concentration of wealth and inheritance are an increasing function of r \`A g where r is the net-of-tax rate of return on wealth and g is the economy's growth rate. This suggests that current trends toward rising wealth\textendash{}income ratios and wealth inequality might continue during the twenty-first century, both because of the slowdown of population and productivity growth, and because of rising international competition to attract capital.},
