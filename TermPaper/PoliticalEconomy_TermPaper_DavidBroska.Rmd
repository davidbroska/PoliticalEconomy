# Introduction

The term "Arab Spring" denotes a variety of regime protests, uprisings and armed rebellions, which differ from each other in several respects. On the one hand, they differ in their extent, ranging from local to nationwide activities, and on the other hand in the achievement of different results: from minor state concessions to appease the population, to stronger reactions in which the government was overthrown. Some countries plunged into civil war and others became autocratic regimes. As a result, social unrest in the affected countries varied widely, going along with remarkable differences in how the distribution of political power of economic resources has changed with the events of Arab Spring. How can these differences between countries be explained?

In fact, economic aspects were one of the main explanations for the political unrest in Arab Spring, which was used not only by many scholars but also by the media. The Economist's "Shoe Thrower's Index" is a remarkable example. It has been assumed that the youth population, years of government,
corruption, GDP per capita and several other indicators measure the vulnerability of Arab countries to revolution.[^economist_details] It turned out that the potential for unrest in the Arab world in 2010 was highest in Yemen, Libya, Egypt and Syria, while countries such as Qatar, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Lebanon achieved the lowest values [@theeconomist2011]. Although the index has no theoretical background, its predictions of social unrest are indeed empirically supported, as discussed below.

In addition, the scientific literature discussed in this paper supports some of the indicators used by the Economist. Consequently, the economic situation appears to be an appropriate indicator of social unrest. However, the economic origins of regime-critical movements can be examined in more detail and from the perspective of a more systematic approach.
Acemoglu and Robinson's [-@acemoglu2006origins] "Economic origins of dictatorship and democracy" is a promising starting point. This paper first discusses aspects of the authors' theoretical framework in order to better understand the circumstances under which revolutionary movements occur in non-democratic states. Second, this paper aims to put their theoretical considerations into an empirical test. Therefore, economic indicators provided by the World Bank [-@worldbank2018] are discussed in the context of the model.

[^economist_details]: See Carbonnier [-@carbonnier2013, 17] for a more detailed discussion of the index. 

# The Revolution Constraint

Acemoglu and Robinson [-@acemoglu2006origins] provide a theoretical framework for the analysis of the emergence of democracies and the dissolution of non-democracies from a game theoretical perspective. It implies strategical behavior of social groups with respect to conflicts of interest. Democracy is preferred by the majority of citizens but rejected by the elites. In nondemocracies, no checks on the power of the elites exist. In other words, elites would be eligible to choose the policies that are most beneficial to them (Ibid, 120). Since individual economic incentives determine political attitudes, there would be no redistribution to the poor or to the middle classes. In the terminology of Acemoglu and Robinson's model the elites, denoted by $\delta$, would set set tax rate $\tau^r$ equal to $0$.

However, the extent to which elites can benefit from their political power is limited by the danger of other groups striking, protesting or even trying to overthrow the ruling regime. It follows that the danger of a revolution puts a constraint on the policies of the elites in non-democracies. Acemoglu and Robinson argue that the likelihood of a revolution depends on the citizens utility in terms of their income before and after a successful revolution (Ibid, 121). Let $1-\theta$ denote the total income accruing to the poor population, $\bar{y}$ the average income and $1-\delta$ the share of the total population that belongs to the poor. Then, the income of a poor agent \textit{before} a revolution is given by
$$V^p=y^p=\frac{(1-\theta)\bar{y}}{1-\delta}.$$
It follows that a high value of $\theta$, the share of income held by rich, implies a high level of inequality. In this case, the constraints imposed on the elites are rather binding. Revolutions are on the one hand
expensive for the elite who lose their privileges in the existing regime. On the other hand, revolutionary events also mean disorder and destruction, so that the productivity of the economy shrinks. 
Stated differently, there is a fraction $\mu$ that is destroyed during the revolution so that the rest $1-\mu$ can be distributed among the poor. Hence, a revolution is more attractive when the value of $\mu$ is small. In the post-revolutionary society the utility $V^P(R, \mu)$ of a poor agent, conditional on that fraction $\mu$, is given by
$$ V^P(R, \mu)=\frac{(1-\mu)\bar{y}}{1-\delta}.$$
This indicates, that total disposable income, denoted by $(1-\mu)\bar{y}$, will be divided among the poor population $1-\delta$. The equations allow to derive the first result for non-democracies: the extent to which the elites can define policies for their benefit is restricted by the potential utility of the poor. In other words, the revolution constraint binds when the potential income of a poor agent in a post-revolutionary society is greater than his current income $y^p$: 
$$\frac{(1-\mu)\bar{y}}{1-\delta} > y^p$$

# Evidence from the Arab Spring

It should be emphasized that this result implies that individuals behave strategically under conditions of complete information. This assumption allows the authors, on the one hand, to create a flexible model for predicting the likelihood of a revolution based on economic indicators. On the other hand, the inherent reduction in complexity requires the model to be tested empirically. Would the model have predicted the revolutionary movements of Arab Spring?

## The case of Egypt

         map(~ read_csv(.) %>% select(`Indicator Name`)) %>% unlist())

# are the 3 required variables available?
wb_data %>% 
  filter(str_detect(Series_Name, "Income share held by (lowest|second|third) 20%")) %>% 
  distinct(Series_Name)

# are there any mising income data within countries at a given point of point?
# there must be either 3 or zero values available

  semi_join(outcomes_df, by = "Country_Name") %>% 
  # select only relevent variables

  group_by(Country_Name, Year) %>% 
  summarise(not_NA_count = sum(!is.na(value)))
  filter(!not_NA_count %in% c(0, 3))

# we can now aggregate the data
```

```{r aggregated-income-share, fig.height=3.5, fig.width=6.5, fig.cap=details_aggr_income_80}

percent_calculated <- wb_data %>%

  distinct(Series_Name) %>%

details_aggr_income_80 <- paste0("Aggregated income share held by the lower ", percent_calculated, "% of the population")

income_lower_80 <- wb_data %>% 
  filter(str_detect(Series_Name, "Income share held by (lowest|second|third|fourth) 20%")) %>% 
  group_by(Year, Country_Name, Country_Code) %>% 
  summarise(value = sum(value))  %>% 
  mutate(Series_Name = paste0("Aggregated income share of lower ", percent_calculated, "%")) 

income_lower_80 %>% 
  plot_worldbank_data(outcomes_df)
```
```{r plot-income-share-highest_20, fig.cap=details_income_share_highest_20 %>% pull(2), eval=FALSE}
details_income_share_highest_20 <- read_csv("../Data/WorldBankData/Income_share_highest_20_percent/Definition and Source.csv")

wb_data %>% 
  filter(str_detect(Series_Name, "Income share held by highest 20%")) %>% 
  group_by(Year, Country_Name, Country_Code, Series_Name) %>% 
  summarise(value = sum(value)) %>% 
  plot_worldbank_data(outcomes_df)
```

Although the income data for the period before and after the major events of the Arab Spring are only available for Egypt, the World Bank database provides evidence for the hypothesized relation between the distribution of incomes and a countries vulnerability for revolutions. Indeed, Figure \@ref(fig:aggregated-income-share) shows that the income share accruing to the lower 80% of Egypt's population increased from `r get_value(income_lower_80, 2010, "Egypt", "lower 80%")`% in 2010 to `r get_value(income_lower_80, 2012, "Egypt", "lower 80%")`% in 2012, one year after the major events of the Arab Spring. 
An economic indicator that is closely related to the income share accruing to different segments of a society is its unemployment rate. It should be noted that according to the literature especially the high unemployment among the youth population accounts for the uprisings of the Arab Spring [@salih2013, 187]. In fact, unemployment among the youth population decreased from `r get_value(wb_data, 2010, "Egypt", "Share of youth not in education, employment or training")`% in 2010 to `r get_value(wb_data, 2013, "Egypt", "Share of youth not in education, employment or training")`% in 2013. These developments generally support Acemoglu and Robinson's idea that revolutions occur when citizens can reasonably assume to gain more than they loose in economic terms.

In addition, World Bank data indicate that the income share held by the top 20% diminished in this period from `r get_value(wb_data, 2010, "Egypt", "highest 20%")`% to `r get_value(wb_data, 2012, "Egypt", "highest 20%")`%. Undoubtedly, these variations might be due to other factors than to the consequences of the revolutionary movements. For example, it is difficult to isolate the effects that account for the growth of income held by the lower 80% of the population. Part of this might be due to the general growth of the country's economy (see Figure \@ref(fig:plot-GDP-per-capita)).
However, the decline in the income share of the top 20% is countered by this general trend. As described in the following, the literature provides a specific explanation for the decline in top incomes.

According to Acemoglu, Hassan and Tahoun [-@acemoglu2018arabic, 2] the main roots of protests in Egypt were corruption, benefiting a small group in close relation to Hosni Mubarak's National Democratic Party (NDP) and repression, with the majority excluded from political participation.
Starting with the resignation of president Mubarak on 11 February 2011, Egypt experienced four government changes until July 2013. Mubarak was followed by a military rule until June 2012, when Mohammed Mursi became elected president. This in turn was followed by a second period of military rule starting in 2013. In their paper, the authors show empirically that the economic fortune of politically connected firms to the incumbent regime fades with the changes of the government (Ibid, 9).
<!-- [^evidence]  -->
Hence, the simultaneous loss of political power of the Mubarak's regime and its connected economic beneficiaries offers a partial explanation for the observed income decline of the top 20% as indicated by the World Bank data. Together with the improvement in the income of the lower 80%, this shift could be interpreted as economic redistribution in the sense of Acemoglu and Robinson's model. 

<!-- Interestingly, this income shift did not last long. In 2015, one year after the beginning of the reign of President Al Sisi, the incomes of the top 20% have risen again from `r get_value(wb_data, 2012, "Egypt", "highest 20%")`% in 2012 to `r get_value(wb_data, 2015, "Egypt", "highest 20%")`%. Accordingly, the incomes of the lower 80% have fallen from `r get_value(income_lower_80, 2012, "Egypt", "lower 80%")`% in 2012 to `r get_value(income_lower_80, 2015, "Egypt", "lower 80%")`% in 2015 (see Figure \@ref(fig:aggregated-income-share)). This in turn allows for the following interpretation. There has been a change of government in Egypt, but unlike Tunisia, the Arab Spring has not been accompanied by any change in political institutions. Although Egypt appeared to undergo a socio political transformation, the country reverted to a military-led authoritarianism by 2013 [@moghadam2018, 1]. It follows that political power has not passed into the hands of those who benefit from redistribution.  -->

<!-- [^evidence]: "For example, we find that in the nine trading days following Mubarak’fall, the value of firms connected to the NDP fell significantly (by about 13%) relative to the value of non-connected firms, indicating a perception of major rent shifts away from these firms in the Egyptian Stock Exchange. Since NDP-connected firms were long-standing beneficiaries of state-sanctioned monopolies (as we document further later), this result is quite plausible." -->

<!-- So far, this equation allows to make predictions about the occurence of revolutions on the level of individual preference. As explained in more detail in the appendix of this paper, however, this equation can be rearranged to $$\mu<\theta$$ which allows to abstract from individidual income to macroecomic indicators. Thus, the model predicts a revolution, if the fraction of the resources that are destroyed during the revolution is smaller than the income accuring to the rich. In order to validate this alternative version of the prediction we need to find a plausible estimate for $\mu$. It seems reasonable to choose the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) or GDP per capita in order to obtain an approximation of the resources destroyed during the events of the Arab Spring. Interestingly, except for Jemen, Lybia and Syria, countries that descended into civil war, the Arab World experienced an economic growth. Although it cannot be excluded that the economic growth could have larger without the events of the Arab Spring, this might lead the to conclusion that citizens did not have to expect a significantly negative economic impact. In terms of the model, if anything, $\mu$ would be less or equal to zero. Regarding $\theta$, the income accruing to rich, it is unreasonable to assume that $\theta$ is equal to or even less than zero. Consequently, the revolution constraint holds since $\mu<\theta$. -->

It should be noted that, according to the model, the occurrence of a revolution, among other criteria, also depends on the policies in the post-revolutionary society. In their game theoretical considerations, Acemoglu and Robinson [-@acemoglu2006origins] discuss the level of taxation in particular. Moreover, they acknowledge the fact that individuals need to coordinate their actions to impose a substantial threat on the incumbent government. Due to the lack of appropriate data, a simpler version of the model is discussed in this term paper. The next chapter, however, shows that the available indicators provide insightful comparative perspectives. Thereby, I will focus on the apparent differences regarding the extent to which Arab countries were affected by major protests. The aim is to further develop the argument that the general economic situation is useful measure of their vulnerability to revolutions and other forms of social unrest.

## A comparative perspective

  pull(2) %>% 
  str_remove("[(]modeled ILO estimate[)]") %>% 
  paste0("")

no_change_over_time <- wb_data %>% 
  filter(Series_Name == "Unemployment, total (% of total labor force) (modeled ILO estimate)",
         !is.na(value)) %>%

  summarise(sd = sd(value), 
            mean = mean(value)) %>%

    #,mean > 0.8
    )

  filter(Series_Name == "Unemployment, total (% of total labor force) (modeled ILO estimate)") %>% 
  anti_join(no_change_over_time, by = "Country_Code") %>% 
  plot_worldbank_data(outcomes_df) + 
  ylab("Unemployment, total (% of total labor force)")

```

```{r plot-GDP-per-capita, fig.height=4, fig.width=6.5, fig.cap=details_gdp_capita}
details_gdp_capita <- read_csv("../Data/WorldBankData/GDP_per_capita/Definition and Source.csv") %>% pull(2) 

wb_data %>% 
  filter(Series_Name=="GDP per capita (current US$)") %>% 
  plot_worldbank_data(outcomes_df) 
```

Algeria, Jordan, Tunisia and Egypt experienced major uprisings [@salih2013, 184]. Protests in Algeria against housing shortages and increased food prices forced the government to lift the state of emergency and subsidize food. Demands against the government in Jordan were followed by the appointment of a new prime minister [@rosiny2016]. Protests in Tunisia and Egypt ultimately culminated in a governmental change. 
In contrast, some Arab countries were not affected by major protest and their regimes remained remarkably stable [@salih2013, 195]. These include the five Gulf monarchies of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman. 
These countries are not geographically separated from countries where major protests took place. However, they differ not only in the extent to which they are affected by the events of Arab Spring, but also in their economic performance. More specifically, Figure \@ref(fig:plot-unemployment-total) allows a distinction to be made between two groups of countries according to the total unemployment rate. Accordingly, the groups also differ in their GDP per capita (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-GDP-per-capita)).

As described in the previous chapter, the model of Acemoglu and Robinson implies that the poor impose a revolutionary thread on the elite only with a sufficiently high economic incentive. Accordingly, Egypt and Tunisia, countries with major protests and consequences, are among the countries with lowest GDP per capita and the highest rate of unemployment. The opposite is true for the Gulf monarchies. Interestingly, no protests occurred in Qatar and the Emirates [@rosiny2016], and those are the countries with the lowest unemployment rate.

It is worth mentioning the reaction of the Gulf monarchies to the events of the smaller protests. Take the case of Saudi Arabia, for example. Salih [-@salih2013, 196] points out that King Abdullah reacted with political and economic reforms that "reduced substantially the magnitude of political turmoil in the nation; in the wake of their announcement, the number of protests in the Kingdom".
Following the model of Acemoglu and Robinson [-@acemoglu2006origins, 132], elites have the opportunity to use repression or concessions to avoid revolution, even if $\mu<\theta$. Thus, one could assume that in Saudi Arabia political and economic concessions by the incumbent regime were effective in calming social unrest.

# Conclusion

The question under which conditions regime changes occur and consolidate is interesting both theoretically and empirically. The focus of this paper was to relate Acemoglu and Robinson's [-@acemoglu2006origins] theoretical account to empirical findings on economic origins and outcomes of the Arabic Spring. Within the limits of an interpretative approach to the data, this paper provided evidence for Acemoglu and Robinson's theoretical framework. Economic indicators are indeed a useful measure of a country's vulnerability for revolutions and other forms of social unrest.

<!-- Tunisia, for example, experienced severe protests among the civil society that were undeniably accompanied by a transition towards a set of more democratic institutions. Similarily, there were also severe protests in Egypt that were followed by a government change. How to explain the differences among those countries regarding the severeness of the regime critical movements and the outcomes of the Arab Spring? -->

<!-- However, there is no evidence that the regime change actually improved the situation of the population in terms of economic welfare or political influence.  -->

<!-- In contrast to these cases Djibouti, Jordan, Kuwait, Moroco, Mauretania and Oman experienced protests  -->

<!-- Most interestingly, the monarchies of the United Arab Emirates and Katar experienced no protests, but reacted with a raise in wages and provided new jobs in the public sector.  there were only minor protests in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain that were violently repressed by the incumbent regimes and there were no concessions made. -->

<!-- Acemoglu and Robinson [@acemoglu2012nations]  -->

<!-- Therefore, in nondemocracies the elites might have the \textit{de jure} political power that they allocate from the incumbent system. Nevertheless, citizens may obtain the \textit{de facto} political power if they are able to coordinate their actions.  -->


<!-- In order to prevent a revolution and to retain their power the elites will give political or economic concessions to majority. Thus, their model suggests that transitions towards democratic occur when the elites are forced to change the system to the benefit of the majority. These theoretical considerations allow to derive three hypotheseses. -->

<!-- 1. Since concessions that change institutions in a long term perspective towards democracy imply major losses to the elites, they should occur less frequently than policies that can be easily withdrawn when the de facto political shifts away from the citizens. (Mention period for observation) -->
<!-- 2. Does the degree of inequality correspond to the severeness of revolutionary movements? Acemoglu and Robinson's model implies that only with a sufficiently high economic incentive the poor can solve the collective action problem. In other words: In countries with higher economic welfare accruing to the poor, political concessions by the incumbent regime were effective to calm down social unrest. In the contrary, lower economic welfare should be related to a higher degree of social unrest.  -->
<!-- 3. What are the economic consequences of a revolution? In the model of Acemoglu and Robinson individuals behave strategically under the conditions of complete information. It follows, that successful regime transitions towards more democratic political institutions should be related to higher share of available resources accruing to the poor in the years after the revolution. (Successful: Tunisia, Unsuccessful: Egypt, ...) -->

<!-- Additionally, transitions from autocratic regimes towards a set of more democratic institutions occur when the de facto political power in the hands of the poor. This is only the case when they are able resolve the collective action problem. -->

<!-- Groups derived from theoretical considerations (main building blocks) and devided by major and minor protests (successful or unsuccessful resolvement of the collective action problem) -->
<!-- - economic incentives -->
<!-- - different interests of political outcomes -->
<!-- - Political institutions play a central role in solving problems of commitment -->
<!-- by affecting the future distribution of de jure political power. -->



<!-- The revolution is costly also for the citizens.  -->

<!-- More specifically, the interest of this paper is twofold:  -->


<!-- # Literature -->

<!-- According to Acemoglu and Robinson [-@acemoglu2006origins] regime transitions and their consolidation depend on political and economic crises, the strenght of civil society, political institutions, the level of economic inequality, the structure of the economy and the form and extent of globalization. The purpose of this section is to review existing literature on the Arabic Spring in order to identify preconditions and outcomes of the Arabic Spring. -->

<!-- ## Preconditions -->

<!-- - Economic impoverishment of the majority of the people -->
<!-- - Deteriorating food security and living standards (Breisinger et al. 2011) -->
<!-- - High rates of unemployment, especially among the youth population (Salih 2013: 187; Hoffman and Jamal 2012: 169f, 184f).  -->
<!-- - Lack of economic free in these countries. The government policies required tremendous administrative steps to set up a formal business (Martin 2012: 94f).  -->

<!-- - The economic impoverishment of the majority of the people, staggering food prices, high rates of unemployment, and especially among the large youth population - are all regarded as plausible roots and causes for the Arab Spring (Salih 2013:187).  -->
<!-- - Especially the deteriorating food security and living standards in the region is said to have led to the uprisings (Breisinger et al. 2011). Another article focuses on the youth population and discusses the Arab Spring in terms of a “youth revolution”.  -->
<!-- - The high unemployment among the young people in this region is seen as a major problem, with youth unemployment as high as 80 % in some areas. The overall conclusion is that frustration with the lack of jobs makes the youth population more prone to protest (Hoffman & Jamal 2012:169f, 184f).  -->
<!-- - Emmanuel Martin claims that one of the more forgotten causes for the Arab Spring was the lack of economic freedom in these countries. The government policies required tremendous administrative steps to set up a formal business, which Martin sees as a part of the political oppression and authoritarianism in these countries (Martin 2012:94f)." from [@carbonnier: 17 f.] -->


<!-- ## Outcomes -->

<!-- ## Minor changes  -->

<!-- Almost at the same time as in Egypt, protests broke out in **Jordan** on January 21, 2011 (UCDP 2011). The protesters were demanding cuts in food and fuel prices, electoral reforms, and more power granted to the parliament. There were, as well, complaints about rampant poverty, high unemployment, and corruption in the country. King Abdullah II, in response, replaced his prime minister, and formed two commissions to study possible electoral reforms and constitutional amendments. He did as well offer a $125 million package of subsidies for fuel, sugar, and other products. There have been occasional violent demonstrations in Jordan, but so far the government’s concessions have managed to keep off most instability, leaving king Abdullah II still in power (BBC 2012; Jones 2013; Helfont & Helfont 2011; Miller 2011:34). -->

<!-- **Lebanon** faced a different sort of demonstrations amid the Arab Spring. While the key slogan in Egypt and Tunisia had been "The people wants to topple the regime", the protest movement in Lebanon adopted a slightly different slogan, "The people wants to topple the sectarian regime". On 27 February 2011, the anti- sectarian movement, as it was referred to, held its first demonstration. The protests were not as much directed against the president, the prime minister or the government, but it was believed that the symbols of powers were located outside the official state institutions (Hermez 2011). However, the movement failed to attract a significant numbers of participants, and in spite of repeated calls, few people showed up for the demonstrations (Khashan 2011). -->

<!-- **Morocco** saw its first protest on February 20, 2011, and demonstrations soon spread and sprung up in over 50 cities (Badimon 2013:207; Miller 2011:36). On March 9, 2011, King Mohammed VI held an extraordinary televised speech to the Moroccan people, in which he promised "a new charter between the throne and the people" and outlined a so called “package of comprehensive constitutional amendments”. The new constitution was to guarantee rule of law and an enhanced role for the prime minister, in practise it would reduce the king’s power and increase that of the elected government. On June 17, 2011, the new constitution was released and in a referendum two weeks later it was passed (Traub 2012:43; Maddy-Weitzman 2012). Whether the concessions done by the Mohammed VI were sincere and will ultimately lead to a political system in line with a constitutional monarchy, is yet to be seen. It is still safe to say that Morocco did not face the same turmoil and uprisings as other countries during the Arab Spring. -->

<!-- ## Major changes -->

<!-- In January 2011, protests broke out in Egypt. After eighteen days of protests in Cairo and in other cities, President Hosni Mubarak was forced to step down on February 11, 2011. This ended Mubarak’s 30 years of power in Egypt. According to the Egyptian government fact-finding panel, 846 people were killed and more than 6,400 were injured during the uprisings. (BBC 2012; Salih 2013:193). -->

<!-- As mentioned in the introduction, the protests in Tunisia began on December 18, 2010. This was sparked by the self-immolation of the vegetable seller Mohamed Bouazizi in the city of Sidi Bouzid. This was done as a political protest. Pro-democratic and anti-regime protests rose up across Tunisia, in what came to be known as the “Jasmine Revolution”. In the violent clashes around 300 people died during the unrest. President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali was toppled, after 23 years in power, on the January 14 2011 (BBC 2012; Schraeder & Redissi 2011). -->

<!-- In Yemen demonstrations started on January 27, 2011, calling for the end of president Ali Abdullah Saleh’s 33-year rule. The president announced at a very early stage that he would not seek re-election and that he would not pass over power to his son. However this did not stop the protests, which became more frequent and widespread. It was also met with a deadly crackdown by the security forces and supporters of the president. In April 2011, Saleh refused to sign a GCC-brokered deal to hand over power in return for immunity from prosecution. This prompted the head of the Hashid tribal federation, Sheikh Sadiq al-Ahmar, to declare his support for the opposition. Heavy clashes between security forces and armed tribesmen occurred in the capital Sanaa, leaving dozens of people dead. In June, president Saleh was seriously injured by a bomb explosion and was forced to leave the country to seek medical treatment. He returned to Yemen in September amid a new wave of violence. In October 2011, the UN Security Council urged the president to agree to the GCC-brokered deal. President Saleh signed the deal November 23, and formally ceded power two days later (BBC 2012; Salih 2013:193-195). -->





<!-- Their model suggests that regime changes are likely to occur when citizens can threaten social disorder.  -->

<!-- These transitions consolidate when when elites do not have strong incentives to interfere.  -->

<!-- The argument of economic incentives equally applies to the elite's preference of non-democratic regimes.  -->


<!-- On the other hand, Dictatorship nevertheless is not stable  In response, when the costs of repression are sufficiently high and promises of concessions are not credible, elites may be forced to create democracy. By democratizing, elites credibly transfer political power to the citizens, ensuring social stability. Democracy consolidates when elites do not have strong incentive to overthrow it. These processes depend on (1) the strength of civil society, (2) the structure of political institutions, (3) the nature of political and economic crises, (4) the level of economic inequality, (5) the structure of the economy, and (6) the form and extent of globalization." (from book description of EOoDaD) -->

<!-- This Term Paper article focusses on the fourth aspect: the level of economic inquality. (Mention no evidence for the relation of increasing income and changes in democracy.) In the model of Acemoglu and Robinson [-@acemoglu2006origins] inter-group inequality and revolutions are related by the possible outcomes of a regime-critical movement. In non-democracies citizens obtain only a small fraction of available resources. With a revolution there is a chance the share the income of the economy minus the what is destroyed. In other words: Does the degree of inequality correspond the severeness of revolutionary movements? -->

 


<!-- "Economic Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy" proposes a game theoretical account that implies strategical behavior with respect to political unrest. There are three cases of a revolution:  -->

<!-- - "If the fraction of what will be destroyed in a revolution is larger than the share of the income of the rich, the tax rate will be zero and there will not be a revolution. -->
<!-- - If the fraction of what will be destroyed in a revolution is smaller than the share of income of the rich and this fraction is smaller than what the poor will get when the elite employs a tax rate according to the preferences of the poor, there still will be a revolution. -->
<!-- - If the fraction of what will be destroyed in a revolution is smaller than the share of income of the rich and this fraction is larger than what the poor will get when the elite employs a tax rate according to the preferences of the poor, the elite will employ a tax rate that prevents a revolution and therefore, there will only be a revolution if that tax rate is lower than the one preferred by the poor and there will not be a revolution if the elite employs a tax rate that is higher/equal to the tax rate preferred by the poor."

<!-- The subsequent graphics provide evidence that economic incentives are a driving force of revolutionary movements. In those countries with lower economic welfare (total unemployment, youth unemployment, GDP per capita ?, income share ?) concessions by the incumbent were effective.

<!-- Notes:  -->

<!-- - Nahen Osten. In fast allen Ländern der Region kam es zu spontanen Demonstrationen, die sich in einigen Staaten zu breiten Protestbewegungen gegen die jeweiligen Regime ausweiteten und die autoritär herrschenden Präsidenten in Tunesien, Ägypten, Libyen und im Jemen stürzten. In den meisten Ländern wurden in der Folge – wenn auch oft nur kosmetische – Reformen durchgeführt. Über fünf Jahre später lässt sich leider nur eine ernüchternde Bilanz des Arabischen Frühlings ziehen, denn kaum eine mit ihm verbundene Erwartung erfüllte sich. Weder kam es zu einer breiten Demokratisierung in der Region, noch gelang es – mit Ausnahme Tunesiens –, verfassungsmäßig garantierte und staatlich geschützte Freiheitsrechte durchzusetzen. Die soziale und wirtschaftliche Lage hat sich in den meisten Ländern weiter verschlechtert, und fast alle autoritären Regime konnten ihre Herrschaft nach einer Phase der Unsicherheit erneut festigen. Mit einer Mischung aus Zuckerbrot und Peitsche, aus partiellen Reformen, finanziellen Vergünstigungen, dem Einsatz von Überwachungstechnologie und staatlicher Repression bis hin zu gewaltsamer Unterdrückung gelang es den Autokraten, die heterogenen Oppositionsbewegungen zu kooptieren, zu spalten, einzuschüchtern und zu unterwerfen. Einzig in Tunesien kam es zu einem Regimewechsel, der in einen anhaltenden, aber keineswegs unumkehrbaren Demokratisierungsprozess mündete. -->

<!-- # Arab Spring -->

<!-- from [@carbonnier] -->

<!-- This chapter offers a brief introduction and overview of the Arab Spring, and the six selected countries for this study. It starts off with an introduction of the Arab Spring, with a general regional introduction, and then continues with each individual country. This introduction only covers the period of time from the beginning of the Arab Spring in December 2010, through the subsequent year of 2011. -->

<!-- - Reason for the selection of six countries? -->

<!-- The Arab Spring, or the Arab uprisings, represents a revolutionary wave of demonstrations and protests that swept through the Arab world. It started off with protests in Tunisia on December 18, 2010, following Mohamed Bouazizi’s self-immolation in protest of ill-treatment and police corruption (Salih 2013:184). This triggered protests in Tunisia, and in January 2011 the Tunisian president Zine el- Abidine Ben Ali was overthrown (Mabon 2012:531). The waves of protests did not stop there, soon the protests spread into the neighbouring Algeria, and broke out in Egypt and Jordan in January 2011. By February 11 violent clashes forced Hosni Mubarak to step down and end his 30-years of power in Egypt (Helfont & Helfont 2011:83). Waves of protests continued to develop throughout the Arab world. Protests emerged in Bahrain, Morocco, Yemen, Jordan, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and Lebanon, as well as Kuwait, Palestine, Iran and Iraq. The Arab Spring left hardly any country unaffected. Civil war broke out in Libya and Syria, where Libya’s Muammar al-Qaddafi was removed from power, whereas in the case of Syria the civil war is still ongoing (Jones 2013:1; Dupont & Passy 2011:447; Blight et al. 2012). Many of the demonstrations during the Arab Spring were also met with a violent response from the authorities, as well as from pro-government militias and counter-demonstrators (Salih 2013:184). -->

<!-- - On February 11 Mubarak was forced to step down, compare to timeline  -->



<!-- # Conclusion -->

<!-- Also beyond the scope / for further research as done by [@carbonnier]:  Moreover, they assume that the inter-group inequality is related to the set of political institutions because an effective thread of revolution initiates the democratization process. Democratization implies a higher influence of the people on the redistribution of the income of an economy. It follows that democratization is attractive for citizens and costly for the elites. In this sense Acomoglu and Robinson emphasize social conflicts between groups as driving force of democratization. -->
