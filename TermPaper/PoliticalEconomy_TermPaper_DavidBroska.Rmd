# Introduction

The Arab Spring denotes a variety of regime critical protests, uprisings and armed rebellions that differ not only with respect to their magnitude ranging from local to nationwide activities. There have also been different outcomes in the countries, varying from minor governmental concessions in order to placate the people, to stronger reactions where the government has been overthrown. Others were descending into civil war, and yet other countries reverted to autocratic regimes. Consequently, there was not only a high variability in the degree of social unrest among the affected countries. There are also remarkable difference regarding how the distribution of political power of economic resources was changed during the events of the Arab Spring. How can those difference among countries be explained?

Acemoglu and Robinson's [-@acemoglu2006origins] "Economic Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy" account is promomising point of departure. First, this paper seeks to apply the theoretical framework of Acemoglu & Robinson [-@acemoglu2006origins] in order to better understand under which circumstances regime ciritical movements occur. Second, this paper seeks to put their theoretical considerations into an empirical test. 

Tunisia, for example, experienced severe protests among the civil society that were undeniably accompanied by a transition towards a set of more democratic institutions. Similarily, there were also severe protests in Egypt that were followed by a government change. How to explain the differences among those countries regarding the severeness of the regime critical movements and the outcomes of the Arab Spring?

However, there is no evidence that the regime change actually improved the situation of the population in terms of economic welfare or political influence. 

In contrast to these cases Djibouti, Jordan, Kuwait, Moroco, Mauretania and Oman experienced protests 


Most interestingly, the monarchies of the United Arab Emirates and Katar experienced no protests, but reacted with a raise in wages and provided new jobs in the public sector.  there were only minor protests in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain that were violently repressed by the incumbent regimes and there were no concessions made.



In fact, economic aspects have been one of the main explanations for the political unrest during the Arab Spring used not only by many scholars, but also by the media. \textit{The Economist}'s "Shoe thrower's Index" is a noteworthy example. Youth population, years of government in power, corruption, GDP per capita, and several other indicators were assumed to measure the Arab countries’ vulnerability for a revolution.[^shoethrower_link] 
It turns out that the potential for unrest in the Arab world in 2010 was highest in Yemen, Libya, Egypt and Syria, while countries like Qatar, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and Lebanon had the lowest scores (The Economist 2011: 26). Even though the index lacks of theoretical backing, not only its predictions of social unrest are empirically supported (see Appendix[^appendix] of this Paper). The scientific literature supports some of the indicators used by the Economist (see Chapter). Consequently, the economic situation seems indeed to be a suitable indicator for social unrest. However, the economic origins of the regime ciritical movements need to be studied in more detail and from the perspective of a more systematic approach. 
Moreover, it remains unclear




The question under which conditions these regime changes occur and consolidate is interesting both theoretically and empirically. 

The focus of this paper is to relate Acemoglu and Robinson's [-@acemoglu2006origins] theoretical account to empirical findings on economic origins and outcomes of the Arabic Spring from existing literature and key economic indicators taken from the World Bank's database. Still, this interpretative approach provides evidence for Acemoglu and Robinson's theoretical framework that can be put to test with a more elaborated methodological approach.

- mention that I will mainly discuss nondemocracies 
- mention that I will exclude countries that descended in civil war `r outcomes_df %>% filter(Overall_Consequences == "Civil War") %>% pull(Country_Name)`

- power centretered in small groups closely connected to Mubarak in Egypt or Ben Ali in Tunesia, people were not given enough
- concessions from the Mubarak regime were not credibel
- ultimately, like in the case of britain transitions to democracy mean economic growth 
- this is unlike the situation were power shifts simply from one elite group to another

# Economic Origins of Democracy and Dictatorship

Acemoglu and Robinson [-@acemoglu2006origins] provide a theoretical framework for analyzing the creation and consolidation of different political institutions from a game theoretical perspective. It implies strategical behavior of social groups with respect to the way they allocate political power and resources in a long term perspective. Democracy, on the one hand, is preferred by the majority of citizens due their gain of political influence on how resources are distributed in a society. On the other hand, nondemocracies regimes are preferred by the elites because resources and power are centered among few individuals. 

## The Revolution Constraint

In the absence of any checks on their power the elites would be eligible to choose the policies that are most beneficial to them (Ibid, 120). Since individual economic incentive determine political attitudes there would be no redistribution to the poor or the middle classes. In the terminology of Acemoglu and Robinson's model the elites, denoted by $\delta$, would set set tax rate $\tau^r$ equal to $0$.
However, the extent to which the elites are able to profit from their political power is restricted by the danger that other groups might attempt to overthrow the incumbent regime. It follows that the danger of a revolution puts a constraint on the policies of the elites in nondemocracy. In the first place, Acemoglu and Robinson (Ibid, 121) argue that the likelyhood of a revolution depends on the citizens utility in terms of their income $y^p$ before and after a successful revolution. Let $1-\theta$ denote the total income accruing to the poor population, $\bar{y}$ the average income and $1-\delta$ the share of the total population that belongs to the poor. Then, the income of a poor agent before a revolution is given by
$$V^p=y^p=\frac{(1-\theta)\bar{y}}{1-\delta}.$$
However, revolutions are costly not only for the elite that looses their privileges in the existing regime. It is reasonable that revolutionary events imply disorder and destruction, so that the productivity of the economy shrinks. Stated differently, there is a fraction $\mu$ that is destroyed during the revolution so that the rest $1-\mu$ can be distributed among the poor. Thus, the utility $V^P(R, \mu)$ of a poor agent in the postrevolutionary society, conditional on that fraction $\mu$, is given by
$$ V^P(R, \mu)=\frac{(1-\mu)\bar{y}}{1-\delta}.$$
This inidicates, that total income available denoted by $(1-\mu)\bar{y}$ will be devided among the poor population $1-\delta$. From these equations Acemoglu and Robinson derive the first result for nondemocracies: The extent to which the elites can define policies to their benefit is restricted by the utility of the poor. In other words, the revolution constraint binds if the potential income of a poor agent in a postrevolutionary society is greater than his current income $y^p$:
$$ \frac{(1-\mu)\bar{y}}{1-\delta} > y^p$$
Still, this result implies that individuals behave strategically under conditions of complete information. On the one hand, this assumption allows the authors to create a model that allows to make prediction about the likelyhood of a revolution based on economic indicators. On the other hand, the flexibility of the model achieved by this reduction of complexity requires the model to be tested empirically. Would the model have predicted the revolutionary movements of the Arab Spring?

```{r check income data for completeness, eval=FALSE}
# check if data is in appropriate folder 
tibble(folder_name = list.files("../Data/WorldBankData", pattern = "Income"),
       meta_data = list.files("../Data/WorldBankData", pattern = "Income", full.names = T) %>%
         list.files(pattern = "Definition", full.names = T) %>% 
         map(~ read_csv(.) %>% select(`Indicator Name`)) %>% unlist())

# are the 3 required variables available?
wb_data %>% 
  filter(str_detect(Series_Name, "Income share held by (lowest|second|third) 20%")) %>% 
  distinct(Series_Name)

# are there any mising income data within countries at a given point of point?
# there must be either 3 or zero values available
wb_data %>% 
  # select only discussed countries 
  semi_join(outcomes_df, by = "Country_Name") %>% 
  # select only relevent variables
  filter(str_detect(Series_Name, "Income share held by (lowest|second|third) 20%")) %>% 
  group_by(Country_Name, Year) %>% 
  summarise(not_NA_count = sum(!is.na(value)))
  filter(!not_NA_count %in% c(0, 3))

# we can now aggregate the data
```

```{r aggregated-income-share, fig.height=3.5, fig.width=6.5, fig.cap="Aggregated income share of lower 80%"}

percent_calculated <- wb_data %>%  
  filter(str_detect(Series_Name, "Income share held by (lowest|second|third|fourth) 20%")) %>%  
  distinct(Series_Name) %>% 
  pull() %>% str_extract("held by.+") %>% str_extract("[0-9]+") %>% as.numeric() %>% sum()

income_lower_80 <- wb_data %>% 
  filter(str_detect(Series_Name, "Income share held by (lowest|second|third|fourth) 20%")) %>% 
  group_by(Year, Country_Name, Country_Code) %>% 
  summarise(value = sum(value))  %>% 
  mutate(Series_Name = paste0("Aggregated income share of lower ", percent_calculated, "%")) 

income_lower_80 %>% 
  plot_worldbank_data(outcomes_df)
```

```{r plot-income-share-highest-20, fig.cap=details_income_share_highest_20 %>% pull(2), eval=FALSE}
details_income_share_highest_20 <- read_csv("../Data/WorldBankData/Income_share_highest_20_percent/Definition and Source.csv")

wb_data %>% 
  filter(str_detect(Series_Name, "Income share held by highest 20%")) %>% 
  group_by(Year, Country_Name, Country_Code, Series_Name) %>% 
  summarise(value = sum(value)) %>% 
  plot_worldbank_data(outcomes_df)
```

Although the income data are only available for Egypt and Djibouti, the World Bank database provides evidence for the hypothesized relation between the distribution of incomes and a countries vulnarability for revolutions. Indeed, figure \@ref(fig:aggregated-income-share) shows that the income share accruing to the lower 80% of Egypt's population increased from `r get_value(income_lower_80, 2010, "Egypt", "lower 80%")`% in 2010 to `r get_value(income_lower_80, 2012, "Egypt", "lower")`% in 2012, one after the major events of the Arab Spring. This development generally supports Acemoglu and Robinson's idea that revolutions occur when citizens can reasonably assume to gain more than they loose. Notably, the incomes of the top 20% deminished in this period from `r get_value(wb_data, 2010, "Egypt", "highest 20%")`% to `r get_value(wb_data, 2012, "Egypt", "highest 20%")`%. Therefore, it seems reasonable that the improvement of the poor was at the expense of the elite. Undoubtedly, this variation might be due to other factors than to the consequences of the revolutionary movements. However, the literature generally supports this interpretation. 

---

So far, this equation allows to make predictions about the occurence of revolutions on the level of individual preference. As explained in more detail in the appendix of this paper, however, this equation can be rearranged to
$$\mu<\theta$$ 
which allows to abstract from individidual income to macroecomic indicators. Thus, the model predicts a revolution, if the fraction of the resources that are destroyed during the revolution is smaller than the income accuring to the rich.[^comment_on_excluding_tax_rate] 

In order to validate this alternative version of the prediction we need to find a plausible estimate for $\mu$. It seems reasonable to choose the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) or GDP per capita in order to obtain an approximation of the resources destroyed during the events of the Arab Spring. Interestingly, except for Jemen, Lybia and Syria, countries that descended into civil war, the Arab World experienced an economic growth. Although it cannot be excluded that the economic growth could have larger without the events of the Arab Spring, this might lead the to conclusion that citizens did not have to expect a significantly negative economic impact. In terms of the model, if anything, $\mu$ would be less or equal to zero. Regarding $\theta$, the income accruing to rich, is equal to or even less than zero. Consequently, the revolution constraint holds since $\mu<\theta$. 



[^comment_on_excluding_tax_rate]: It should be noted that according to model the occurence of a revolution also depends on the policies in the postrevolutionary society. In their game theoretical considerations Acemoglu and Robinson [-@acemoglu2006origins] discuss the level of taxation in particular. However, this paper discusses a simpler version of the model due to a lack of appropriate data. 


```{r plotGDPpercapita, out.width='90%', fig.cap=details_gdp_capita %>% pull(2)}
details_gdp_capita <- read_csv("../Data/WorldBankData/GDP_per_capita/Definition and Source.csv")

wb_data %>% 
  filter(Series_Name=="GDP per capita (current US$)") %>% 
  plot_worldbank_data(outcomes_df) 
```


## Collective Action Problem

```{r include bpb infographic}
knitr::include_graphics("../Figures/bpb_arabischer_fruehling.jpg")
```


Therefore, in nondemocracies the elites might have the \textit{de jure} political power that they allocate from the incumbent system. Nevertheless, citizens may obtain the \textit{de facto} political power if they are able to coordinate their actions. 


In order to prevent a revolution and to retain their power the elites will give political or economic concessions to majority. Thus, their model suggests that transitions towards democratic occur when the elites are forced to change the system to the benefit of the majority. These theoretical considerations allow to derive three hypotheseses.

1. Since concessions that change institutions in a long term perspective towards democracy imply major losses to the elites, they should occur less frequently than policies that can be easily withdrawn when the de facto political shifts away from the citizens. (Mention period for observation)
2. Does the degree of inequality correspond to the severeness of revolutionary movements? Acemoglu and Robinson's model implies that only with a sufficiently high economic incentive the poor can solve the collective action problem. In other words: In countries with higher economic welfare accruing to the poor, political concessions by the incumbent regime were effective to calm down social unrest. In the contrary, lower economic welfare should be related to a higher degree of social unrest. 
3. What are the economic consequences of a revolution? In the model of Acemoglu and Robinson individuals behave strategically under the conditions of complete information. It follows, that successful regime transitions towards more democratic political institutions should be related to higher share of available resources accruing to the poor in the years after the revolution. (Successful: Tunisia, Unsuccessful: Egypt, ...)

Additionally, transitions from autocratic regimes towards a set of more democratic institutions occur when the de facto political power in the hands of the poor. This is only the case when they are able resolve the collective action problem.

Groups derived from theoretical considerations (main building blocks) and devided by major and minor protests (successful or unsuccessful resolvement of the collective action problem)
- economic incentives
- different interests of political outcomes
- Political institutions play a central role in solving problems of commitment
by affecting the future distribution of de jure political power.



The revolution is costly also for the citizens.

<!-- # Literature -->

<!-- According to Acemoglu and Robinson [-@acemoglu2006origins] regime transitions and their consolidation depend on political and economic crises, the strenght of civil society, political institutions, the level of economic inequality, the structure of the economy and the form and extent of globalization. The purpose of this section is to review existing literature on the Arabic Spring in order to identify preconditions and outcomes of the Arabic Spring. -->

<!-- ## Preconditions -->

<!-- - Economic impoverishment of the majority of the people -->
<!-- - Deteriorating food security and living standards (Breisinger et al. 2011) -->
<!-- - High rates of unemployment, especially among the youth population (Salih 2013: 187; Hoffman and Jamal 2012: 169f, 184f).  -->
<!-- - Lack of economic free in these countries. The government policies required tremendous administrative steps to set up a formal business (Martin 2012: 94f).  -->

<!-- - The economic impoverishment of the majority of the people, staggering food prices, high rates of unemployment, and especially among the large youth population - are all regarded as plausible roots and causes for the Arab Spring (Salih 2013:187).  -->
<!-- - Especially the deteriorating food security and living standards in the region is said to have led to the uprisings (Breisinger et al. 2011). Another article focuses on the youth population and discusses the Arab Spring in terms of a “youth revolution”.  -->
<!-- - The high unemployment among the young people in this region is seen as a major problem, with youth unemployment as high as 80 % in some areas. The overall conclusion is that frustration with the lack of jobs makes the youth population more prone to protest (Hoffman & Jamal 2012:169f, 184f).  -->
<!-- - Emmanuel Martin claims that one of the more forgotten causes for the Arab Spring was the lack of economic freedom in these countries. The government policies required tremendous administrative steps to set up a formal business, which Martin sees as a part of the political oppression and authoritarianism in these countries (Martin 2012:94f)." from [@carbonnier: 17 f.] -->


<!-- ## Outcomes -->

<!-- ## Minor changes  -->

<!-- Almost at the same time as in Egypt, protests broke out in **Jordan** on January 21, 2011 (UCDP 2011). The protesters were demanding cuts in food and fuel prices, electoral reforms, and more power granted to the parliament. There were, as well, complaints about rampant poverty, high unemployment, and corruption in the country. King Abdullah II, in response, replaced his prime minister, and formed two commissions to study possible electoral reforms and constitutional amendments. He did as well offer a $125 million package of subsidies for fuel, sugar, and other products. There have been occasional violent demonstrations in Jordan, but so far the government’s concessions have managed to keep off most instability, leaving king Abdullah II still in power (BBC 2012; Jones 2013; Helfont & Helfont 2011; Miller 2011:34). -->

<!-- **Lebanon** faced a different sort of demonstrations amid the Arab Spring. While the key slogan in Egypt and Tunisia had been "The people wants to topple the regime", the protest movement in Lebanon adopted a slightly different slogan, "The people wants to topple the sectarian regime". On 27 February 2011, the anti- sectarian movement, as it was referred to, held its first demonstration. The protests were not as much directed against the president, the prime minister or the government, but it was believed that the symbols of powers were located outside the official state institutions (Hermez 2011). However, the movement failed to attract a significant numbers of participants, and in spite of repeated calls, few people showed up for the demonstrations (Khashan 2011). -->

<!-- **Morocco** saw its first protest on February 20, 2011, and demonstrations soon spread and sprung up in over 50 cities (Badimon 2013:207; Miller 2011:36). On March 9, 2011, King Mohammed VI held an extraordinary televised speech to the Moroccan people, in which he promised "a new charter between the throne and the people" and outlined a so called “package of comprehensive constitutional amendments”. The new constitution was to guarantee rule of law and an enhanced role for the prime minister, in practise it would reduce the king’s power and increase that of the elected government. On June 17, 2011, the new constitution was released and in a referendum two weeks later it was passed (Traub 2012:43; Maddy-Weitzman 2012). Whether the concessions done by the Mohammed VI were sincere and will ultimately lead to a political system in line with a constitutional monarchy, is yet to be seen. It is still safe to say that Morocco did not face the same turmoil and uprisings as other countries during the Arab Spring. -->

<!-- ## Major changes -->

<!-- In January 2011, protests broke out in Egypt. After eighteen days of protests in Cairo and in other cities, President Hosni Mubarak was forced to step down on February 11, 2011. This ended Mubarak’s 30 years of power in Egypt. According to the Egyptian government fact-finding panel, 846 people were killed and more than 6,400 were injured during the uprisings. (BBC 2012; Salih 2013:193). -->

<!-- As mentioned in the introduction, the protests in Tunisia began on December 18, 2010. This was sparked by the self-immolation of the vegetable seller Mohamed Bouazizi in the city of Sidi Bouzid. This was done as a political protest. Pro-democratic and anti-regime protests rose up across Tunisia, in what came to be known as the “Jasmine Revolution”. In the violent clashes around 300 people died during the unrest. President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali was toppled, after 23 years in power, on the January 14 2011 (BBC 2012; Schraeder & Redissi 2011). -->

<!-- In Yemen demonstrations started on January 27, 2011, calling for the end of president Ali Abdullah Saleh’s 33-year rule. The president announced at a very early stage that he would not seek re-election and that he would not pass over power to his son. However this did not stop the protests, which became more frequent and widespread. It was also met with a deadly crackdown by the security forces and supporters of the president. In April 2011, Saleh refused to sign a GCC-brokered deal to hand over power in return for immunity from prosecution. This prompted the head of the Hashid tribal federation, Sheikh Sadiq al-Ahmar, to declare his support for the opposition. Heavy clashes between security forces and armed tribesmen occurred in the capital Sanaa, leaving dozens of people dead. In June, president Saleh was seriously injured by a bomb explosion and was forced to leave the country to seek medical treatment. He returned to Yemen in September amid a new wave of violence. In October 2011, the UN Security Council urged the president to agree to the GCC-brokered deal. President Saleh signed the deal November 23, and formally ceded power two days later (BBC 2012; Salih 2013:193-195). -->





<!-- Their model suggests that regime changes are likely to occur when citizens can threaten social disorder.  -->

<!-- These transitions consolidate when when elites do not have strong incentives to interfere.  -->

<!-- The argument of economic incentives equally applies to the elite's preference of non-democratic regimes.  -->


<!-- On the other hand, Dictatorship nevertheless is not stable  In response, when the costs of repression are sufficiently high and promises of concessions are not credible, elites may be forced to create democracy. By democratizing, elites credibly transfer political power to the citizens, ensuring social stability. Democracy consolidates when elites do not have strong incentive to overthrow it. These processes depend on (1) the strength of civil society, (2) the structure of political institutions, (3) the nature of political and economic crises, (4) the level of economic inequality, (5) the structure of the economy, and (6) the form and extent of globalization." (from book description of EOoDaD) -->

<!-- This Term Paper article focusses on the fourth aspect: the level of economic inquality. (Mention no evidence for the relation of increasing income and changes in democracy.) In the model of Acemoglu and Robinson [-@acemoglu2006origins] inter-group inequality and revolutions are related by the possible outcomes of a regime-critical movement. In non-democracies citizens obtain only a small fraction of available resources. With a revolution there is a chance the share the income of the economy minus the what is destroyed. In other words: Does the degree of inequality correspond the severeness of revolutionary movements? -->

 


<!-- "Economic Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy" proposes a game theoretical account that implies strategical behavior with respect to political unrest. There are three cases of a revolution:  -->

<!-- - "If the fraction of what will be destroyed in a revolution is larger than the share of the income of the rich, the tax rate will be zero and there will not be a revolution. -->
<!-- - If the fraction of what will be destroyed in a revolution is smaller than the share of income of the rich and this fraction is smaller than what the poor will get when the elite employs a tax rate according to the preferences of the poor, there still will be a revolution. -->
<!-- - If the fraction of what will be destroyed in a revolution is smaller than the share of income of the rich and this fraction is larger than what the poor will get when the elite employs a tax rate according to the preferences of the poor, the elite will employ a tax rate that prevents a revolution and therefore, there will only be a revolution if that tax rate is lower than the one preferred by the poor and there will not be a revolution if the elite employs a tax rate that is higher/equal to the tax rate preferred by the poor."

<!-- ## Inequality -->

<!-- The subsequent graphics provide evidence that economic incentives are a driving force of revolutionary movements. In those countries with lower economic welfare (total unemployment, youth unemployment, GDP per capita ?, income share ?) concessions by the incumbent were effective. In the context of the model of Acemoglu and Robinson's the thread of revolution was not credible because of higher economic welfare compared to other Arabic countries. -->

## Inequality


- Commitment problem: In Egypt inequality decreased after the events of the regime change but again increased afterwards
- Only one more observation that allows comparing before and after the political unrest: in Morocco there was no major change regarding inequality

```

## Unemployment

- Tunisia: unemployment decreases
- Cost of Revolution: The result of the Arab Spring is a higher unemployment rate except for Morocco, Bahrain and Yemen the Arab
- Strongest increase in case of Syria, Tunisia (and Libya)
- Group differences: In those countries with lower unemployment concessions were made.

- Explanation of social unrest: As supported by other sources younger population of Egypt suffered from high unemployment compared to the overall unemployment.
- Concessions and lower unemployment: Cost of revolution too high respectively economic incentive too low?

#- in case of Egypt, Bahrain and Tunisia tax rate increases with political unrest compared to period before
#- in case of Jordan and Morocco the tax rate declines
#- not necessarily correlated with political unrest: state could impose higher taxes due to the costs of the revolution also on the elites
#- taxation that affects especially the rich population? `r details_toipacg %>% pull(3)`

<!-- Notes:  -->

<!-- - Nahen Osten. In fast allen Ländern der Region kam es zu spontanen Demonstrationen, die sich in einigen Staaten zu breiten Protestbewegungen gegen die jeweiligen Regime ausweiteten und die autoritär herrschenden Präsidenten in Tunesien, Ägypten, Libyen und im Jemen stürzten. In den meisten Ländern wurden in der Folge – wenn auch oft nur kosmetische – Reformen durchgeführt. Über fünf Jahre später lässt sich leider nur eine ernüchternde Bilanz des Arabischen Frühlings ziehen, denn kaum eine mit ihm verbundene Erwartung erfüllte sich. Weder kam es zu einer breiten Demokratisierung in der Region, noch gelang es – mit Ausnahme Tunesiens –, verfassungsmäßig garantierte und staatlich geschützte Freiheitsrechte durchzusetzen. Die soziale und wirtschaftliche Lage hat sich in den meisten Ländern weiter verschlechtert, und fast alle autoritären Regime konnten ihre Herrschaft nach einer Phase der Unsicherheit erneut festigen. Mit einer Mischung aus Zuckerbrot und Peitsche, aus partiellen Reformen, finanziellen Vergünstigungen, dem Einsatz von Überwachungstechnologie und staatlicher Repression bis hin zu gewaltsamer Unterdrückung gelang es den Autokraten, die heterogenen Oppositionsbewegungen zu kooptieren, zu spalten, einzuschüchtern und zu unterwerfen. Einzig in Tunesien kam es zu einem Regimewechsel, der in einen anhaltenden, aber keineswegs unumkehrbaren Demokratisierungsprozess mündete. -->

<!-- # Arab Spring -->

<!-- from [@carbonnier] -->

<!-- This chapter offers a brief introduction and overview of the Arab Spring, and the six selected countries for this study. It starts off with an introduction of the Arab Spring, with a general regional introduction, and then continues with each individual country. This introduction only covers the period of time from the beginning of the Arab Spring in December 2010, through the subsequent year of 2011. -->

<!-- - Reason for the selection of six countries? -->

<!-- The Arab Spring, or the Arab uprisings, represents a revolutionary wave of demonstrations and protests that swept through the Arab world. It started off with protests in Tunisia on December 18, 2010, following Mohamed Bouazizi’s self-immolation in protest of ill-treatment and police corruption (Salih 2013:184). This triggered protests in Tunisia, and in January 2011 the Tunisian president Zine el- Abidine Ben Ali was overthrown (Mabon 2012:531). The waves of protests did not stop there, soon the protests spread into the neighbouring Algeria, and broke out in Egypt and Jordan in January 2011. By February 11 violent clashes forced Hosni Mubarak to step down and end his 30-years of power in Egypt (Helfont & Helfont 2011:83). Waves of protests continued to develop throughout the Arab world. Protests emerged in Bahrain, Morocco, Yemen, Jordan, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and Lebanon, as well as Kuwait, Palestine, Iran and Iraq. The Arab Spring left hardly any country unaffected. Civil war broke out in Libya and Syria, where Libya’s Muammar al-Qaddafi was removed from power, whereas in the case of Syria the civil war is still ongoing (Jones 2013:1; Dupont & Passy 2011:447; Blight et al. 2012). Many of the demonstrations during the Arab Spring were also met with a violent response from the authorities, as well as from pro-government militias and counter-demonstrators (Salih 2013:184). -->

<!-- - On February 11 Mubarak was forced to step down, compare to timeline  -->



<!-- # Conclusion -->

<!-- Also beyond the scope / for further research as done by [@carbonnier]:  Moreover, they assume that the inter-group inequality is related to the set of political institutions because an effective thread of revolution initiates the democratization process. Democratization implies a higher influence of the people on the redistribution of the income of an economy. It follows that democratization is attractive for citizens and costly for the elites. In this sense Acomoglu and Robinson emphasize social conflicts between groups as driving force of democratization. -->
